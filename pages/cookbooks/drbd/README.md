Installs and configures the Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD) service for mirroring block devices between a pair of hosts. Right now it simply works in pairs, multiple hosts could be supported with a few small changes.

The `drbd` cookbook does not partition drives. It will format partitions given a filesystem type, but it does not explicitly depend on the `xfs` cookbook if you want that type of filesystem, but you can put it in your run list and set the node['drbd']['fs_type'] to 'xfs' or 'ext4' or whatever.

## Maintainers

This cookbook is maintained by the Sous Chefs. The Sous Chefs are a community of Chef cookbook maintainers working together to maintain important cookbooks.

## Requirements

### Platforms

- Ubuntu
- CentOS

### Chef

- Chef 12.15+

### Cookbooks

- yum-elrepo

## Recipes

### default

Installs drbd but does no configuration. If another version of drbd is desired, set the `node['drbd']['packages']` attribute.

For example, to install drdb 8.4 on CentOS you might set `node.override['drbd']['packages'] = %w(drbd84-utils kmod-drbd84)`.

## pair

Given a filesystem and a partner host, configures block replication between the hosts. The master will claim the primary, format the filesystem and mount the partition. The slave will simply mirror without mounting. **It currently takes 2 chef-client runs to ensure the pair is synced properly.**

## Attributes

The required attributes are

- `node['drbd']['remote_host']` - Remote host to pair with.
- `node['drbd']['remote_ip']` - Remote host to pair with.
- `node['drbd']['local_ip']` - Remote host to pair with.
- `node['drbd']['disk']` - Disk partition to mirror.
- `node['drbd']['mount']` - Mount point to mirror.
- `node['drbd']['fs_type']` - Disk format for the mirrored disk, defaults to `ext3`.
- `node['drbd']['master']` - Whether this node is master between the pair, defaults to `false`.

The optional attributes are

- `node['drbd']['packages']` - What packages are needed to install drbd, defaults to `drbd_packages` helper.

## Roles

There are a pair of example roles `drbd-pair.rb` and `drbd-pair-master.rb` with the cookbook source.
