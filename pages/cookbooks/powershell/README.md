## Requirements

Not every version of Windows supports every version of Powershell. The following table illustrates Powershell support across the Windows family. **Included** means that the base installation of the operating system includes the indicated version of Powershell.

Windows Version                     | PowerShell 2.0 | PowerShell 3.0 | PowerShell 4.0 | PowerShell 5.0
----------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------

Windows Server 2012R2 / Windows 8.1 | Included       | Not Available  | Included       | Supported

### Chef

- Chef 13+

### Cookbooks

- windows 3.0+

PowerShell also requires the appropriate version of the Microsoft .NET Framework to be installed, if the operating system does not ship with that version. The following community cookbooks are used to install the correct version of the .NET Framework:

- ms_dotnet

## Resources

### `powershell_module`

#### Deprecated

The `powershell_module` has been removed from this cookbook as it was non-functional for most needs and has been replaced with built in resources in chef:

- [powershell_package_source](https://docs.chef.io/resource_powershell_package_source.html)
- [powershell_package](https://docs.chef.io/resource_powershell_package.html)

## Usage

**Note**: The installation may require a restart of the node being configured before PowerShell can be used.

### default

The default recipe contains no resources and will do nothing if included on a run_list.
